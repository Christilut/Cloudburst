Cloudburst
==========


Attempt at creating a videoplayer to stream torrents.

Mainly contains the experimental back-end to download torrents sequentially and allows seeking in MKV, MP4 files.

Feel free to use any part of it. Drop a line to me if you use it somewhere (or have questions), I'd be interested to know about it :)
